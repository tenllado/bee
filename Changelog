Version 2.0

- Added the shifter register with the 7 Segment display.
- Modified the polarization network for analog sensors and its connection to the
ADC.
- Simplified the PWM header. Buzzer has now one pin connected to ground and the
other can be connected with a jumper to gpi12 or gpi13 for PWM0 and PWM1
respectively.
- GPIO18 was added to the RS232 block for simplicity, should not affect the use
of RS232 if not used, but cannot be used if an FTDI cable is connected. This may
change in future revisions.

Version 1.0

Initial version after fixing some minor issues found in the first prototype and
some additional headers where added to the board to help connecting analog
sensors to the ADC and polarice them.

Some bugs where found but not corrected:
- C3: the footprint should be replaced for a polarized capacitor footprint.
- Rev number in the board should be 1.0
