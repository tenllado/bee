Version 2.0

- Added the shifter register with the 7 Segment display.
- Modified the polarization network for analog sensors, including now 8 fixed
registers and 2 potenciometers. The network is indpendent of the ADC block but
can easily be connected. DIP switches are used to provide Vcc or GND for the
polarization on both ends. In addition, pin headers have been added to it to
enable parallel and serial combination of the resistors available.
- Simplified the PWM header. Buzzer has now one pin connected to ground and the
other can be connected with a jumper to gpi12 or gpi13 for PWM0 and PWM1
respectively.
- GPIO18 was added to the pin header J17, with the i2c signals
- Pin header J17 was made compatible with Pimoroni Breakouts
(https://thepihut.com/collections/pimoroni-breakouts), except that the GPIO4 was
replaced by GPIO18. The GPIO4 is in most of them not used or optionally used.
The pin 4 should be replaced in software by pin 18 in case it is needed.
- New jumper with gnd connections.
- An RGB led module was included.
- Migrated to kicad 6.0

Version 1.0

Initial version after fixing some minor issues found in the first prototype and
some additional headers where added to the board to help connecting analog
sensors to the ADC and polarice them.

Some bugs where found but not corrected:
- C3: the footprint should be replaced for a polarized capacitor footprint.
- Rev number in the board should be 1.0
